Geany Snippets
==============


Installing the Snippets on Linux
--------------------------------

To install snippets for a particular file type, add the content of the relevant file to the `~/.config/geany/snippets.conf` file. For example:

    cat <filetype>_snippets.conf >> ~/.config/geany/snippets.conf

The snippets are loaded automatically the next time you run [Geany](http://geany.org/) and open a DocBook file.
